# Brastlewark

### Problem:
Our heroes have just arrived at a gnome town called Brastlewark, and they need to facilitate trade with the local population. 

### Solution:
This app allows our heroes to browse all the inhabitants' details from their mobile phones. They can search for a gnome by name and see the chosen gnome's ID card, which features their gender, age, height, weight, hair colour, friends, and professions.
